# [Microsoft todo web app](https://to-do.microsoft.com/tasks/) clone built with webpack, HTML and CSS in 2 days.

> The guests can create lists of todos, add/delete and edit todos based on their description/priority/due date/notes and title. The app never does a full refresh of the page and it automatically updates the DOM with every change. It is using `localStorage` for the database. <br>
> In this project, we were required to build a todo web app using Javascript`s Objects, Factory Functions, and The Module Patterns applying the concepts of Single Responsibility and Tightly Coupled Objects.

## App functionality

- Guests can create lists of todos, add/delete and edit todos based on their description/priority/due date/notes and title.
